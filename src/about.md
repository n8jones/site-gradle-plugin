![Nate Jones](http://natejones.me/sites/default/files/uploads/2014/08/ProfilePic.jpg)

I'm Nate Jones.  I'm a leader, public speaker, and software engineer. An amateur philosopher. Part time world problem solver. I'm a resident of Morgantown, WV, and I love my town. I'm a free thinking, analytically minded, optimistic realist.

I'm always up for a chat, so look me up on the social networks below.
