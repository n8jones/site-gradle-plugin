title: The Hoss Foundation Launches A New Website
---
After weeks of development, we took the new Hoss Foundation website live last night! This site gives the Hoss Foundation far better multimedia capabilities and the ability to more quickly engage their supporters online. Check it out at http://hossfoundation.com

For those of you who don't know...

> The Hoss Foundation, founded by former NFL QB Jeff Hostetler and his wife Vicky, is a 501 (c) (3) non profit organization established to help meet the needs of children and/or families facing hardships due to traumatic injury, illness, or financial crisis.

The Hoss Foundation is one of my favorite non-profit humanitarian organizations. Chestnut Ridge Church Student Ministry has partnered with the Hoss Foundation on several projects. Weâ€™ve been involved with their annual Gift Project for the past several years and this year our small groups have been participating in the Days of Hope project.

So when I was asked to help implement the new online face of the Hoss Foundation I was stoked to be involved.

Nick Fryer, of the Performance Results Corporation (PRC), came up with the brand new site design concept. PRC also contributed copy for a lot of the new content.

My responsibility was to get a content management system (CMS) set up with the new look and feel. I also got tasked with importing the existing and new content into the new CMS.

I decided to go with Drupal for the CMS since it is the one that I am the most familiar with and I knew that I could get all the functionality that the Hoss Foundation was requesting out of it.

For hosting we decided to go with Drupal Gardens. I had never used this service before, but I was tremendously impressed with it. The site was easy to set up and configure. And their Theme Builder tool made implementing the custom Drupal Theme super easy. With the Theme Builder I was able to implement an extremely customized look and feel with less than 150 lines of CSS. Unreal!!

The Hoss Foundation really is an incredible organization, so please check them out!
