title: Eclipse RCP Resources
---
While researching Eclipse RCP applications for an upcoming project, I found that it was really hard to find clear concise documentation on the subject.  So I'm making note of some of the resources that I found most useful here.

*  [Minimal RCP Application Built With Tycho](https://github.com/n8jones/TestTycho) - These are the files that I used to build a minimal [Eclipse RCP](http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform) application with [Maven+Tycho](http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/).  It includes all the java, maven, and eclipse files to build a custom application.
*  [The Tesla Tycho Book](https://github.com/tesla/book-tycho/blob/master/en/01-introduction/01-chapter1.md) - I found this to be one of the most helpful resources for going step by step through the process of setting up a Tycho project.
*  [The Vogella Tycho Tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html) - This tutorial was really good and very detailed.  Required a little more familiarity with Eclipse RCP.
*  [The Google+ Eclipse RCP &amp; Plug-in Development Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/103535641765673802586) - I tried several different places to ask some questions about Eclipse RCP.  I felt like I got some of the most useful feedback from this community.
*  [Eclipse Documentation](http://help.eclipse.org) - I found some extremely useful documentation under the heading Platform Plug-in Developer Guide.  Very detailed.  (Unfortunately this is one of the worst built documentation sites I've ever seen.  I couldn't even find a decent way to link to the exact page I wanted.)
